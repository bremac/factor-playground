This repository contains some miscellaneous factor modules:

* `anagrams`: generate all anagrams of a phrase using a specified word-list.

* `binary-skew-numbers`: isomorphic to Okasaki's purely-functional arrays.

* `deadlock-detection`: detect deadlocks by available / request / allocated.

* `functional-deps`: minimize relational functional dependencies from the REPL.

* `liars`: Solution to the Liar, Liar facebook puzzle (deprecated.)

* `persistent/arrays`: Okasaki's skew binary random access lists. Made
  redundant by factor's built-in persistent sequences.

* `undirected-graph`: Simple undirected graph collection used by liars.
